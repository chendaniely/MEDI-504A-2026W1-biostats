# The class notes prompt

> This is all AI/Claude generated

We are building one prompt together that turns a class transcript into notes.
You propose changes, we merge them, and **all** of the course's notes get regenerated from
the result — so an improvement you make after the lab also improves the notes for the lecture.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`prompt-notes.md`](prompt-notes.md) | **The prompt.** Every word of it is sent to the model, followed by a session's transcript and slides. This is the file we edit together. |
| `prompt-notes-<name>.md` | Optional variants, for trying an idea next to the main prompt (see below). |
| `README-prompt.md` | This file: how it all works, and how to change it. |
| [`Makefile`](https://github.com/chendaniely/MEDI-504A-2026W1-biostats/blob/main/Makefile) | Shortcuts for running the generator (`make notes` and the others below). |

## What it produces

Each class session has a folder under `sessions/`, named by date — with a suffix such
as `-lecture` or `-lab` when there were two classes that day:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `plaud.md` | share link to the recording |
| `transcript-plaud.md` | the transcript: machine-generated, lightly cleaned up by Plaud ← input |
| `materials.md` | the session's slides from the course website: their text, the R code, and the output it printed, each heading linked to its slide ← input |
| `notes-plaud.md` | Plaud's own AI notes — the baseline to beat |
| `notes-class-main--<model>.md` | what `prompt-notes.md` produced, and which model wrote it ← output |

Reading `notes-plaud.md` and `notes-class-main--<model>.md` side by side is the point.
Plaud's notes come from a generic summariser that has never heard of this course. Ours
know what the course is about, turn "see you Wednesday" into a real date, and keep the
questions people asked.

The slides make a big difference. Speech is a bad way to record code: a microphone hears
"percent greater percent" where the slide says `%>%`, and the arguments disappear. The
instructor live-codes from the slides, so the prompt treats them as the authority on what
was typed and what it printed, and links each piece of code back to its slide.

Notes come from more than one model: Claude (`--claude-opus-…`) and open-weights Qwen
models run on the instructor's own hardware (`--qwen…`), so you can compare them too.

## How to propose a change

Ordinary Git and GitHub practice. From a terminal:

```bash
git switch -c prompt/your-change-here      # new branch
$EDITOR prompt-notes.md                    # make your edit
git add prompt-notes.md
git commit -m "Ask for a glossary of new functions"
git push -u origin prompt/your-change-here
```

Or on GitHub itself: open `prompt-notes.md`, click the pencil icon, make your edit, and
choose **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.

In the pull request, say **what problem the change fixes**. The convincing version is a
before/after on one session (see below), quoting the part that got better. A good change
fixes something you can point at — a section that comes out thin, a date the notes got
wrong, a kind of content the notes keep dropping. "Make it better" is not something we
can evaluate.

To try a bigger idea next to the main prompt instead of in place of it, copy it to
`prompt-notes-<name>.md` (say `prompt-notes-glossary.md`). Its notes come out as
`notes-class-glossary--<model>.md`, beside the main ones, so the two can be compared.

## Running it yourself

The generator is `class_notes.py`, in the `class-notes/scripts/` folder of the public
[`chendaniely/skills`](https://github.com/chendaniely/skills) repository. It needs Python 3
and, for Claude models, the [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI, logged in
once (`claude`, then `/login`). It runs on your Claude subscription: no API key is needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chendaniely/skills ~/git/skills      # once
cn=~/git/skills/class-notes/scripts/class_notes.py

python3 $cn generate --dry-run                                     # what would run
python3 $cn generate --only sessions/2026-11-02 --prompt glossary
python3 $cn generate --only sessions/2026-11-02 --force --model sonnet
python3 $cn payload --only sessions/2026-11-02 > message.txt
```

`payload` prints the exact message the model receives — the prompt, the transcript and the
slides — so you can take a session to any other tool or model and do your own thing with it.
No Claude subscription? Paste that message into GitHub Copilot Chat in your Codespace, or
another assistant.
The `Makefile` wraps the common runs (`make notes`, `make notes-force`); point it at your
copy with `CLASS_NOTES=~/git/skills/class-notes/scripts/class_notes.py`.

## The version history is the Git history

There is one prompt file, not `v1.md`, `v2.md`, `v3.md`: `git log -p prompt-notes.md`
shows every revision with its diff. Every generated notes file ends with a footer that
records where it came from:

```
---

- prompt: prompt-notes.md @ a1b2c3d
- prompt-hash: 3f9c0e2b7a41
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (requested: opus)
- backend: claude
- inputs: transcript-plaud.md, materials.md
- generated: 2026-11-04
```

`opus` is an **alias** meaning "the latest Opus", and what it points at changes over time;
`claude-opus-5-5` is the model that actually ran, which is why it is also in the filename.
When the alias moves to a newer model, regenerated notes land in a new file next to the
old one, so models can be compared too. `inputs` says whether the notes had the slides or
only the transcript. `prompt-hash` is a fingerprint of the prompt's words, so a commit
that doesn't change them (a rename, a revert) never makes old notes look out of date.
A prompt shown as `@ uncommitted` was run before that version of it was committed;
the `prompt-hash` still pins down its exact words.

## A note on privacy

These transcripts include your voices, and this repository is public on GitHub, so anyone
can read them, and anyone with a session's `plaud.md` link can play its recording.
Students appear in the transcript as `Speaker 1`, `Speaker 2`, and so on. The prompt
instructs the model to keep it that way and never to attach a name to a question. If you
change the prompt, keep that rule.
